# Hey, I’m Sam 🧠✨

> Web3 learner by moonlight. Building my way to freedom—one contract at a time.

---

### 🔭 Currently:
- Learning **Solidity** and **Smart Contract Security**
- Exploring **Testnets** & airdrops like it’s side-quest season 🎯
- Mapping out **Soulstack**, my mythological chain of value
- Diving into **Foundry** soon (once the laptop prophecy is fulfilled)

---

### 🌱 On My Path To:
- Building meaningful **DeFi tools** for people like me
- Becoming a trusted voice in **Web3** by showing, not just telling
- Living off code, creativity & community

---

### 🧰 Tools, Skills & Spells:
- `Solidity` | `Remix IDE` | `Git` | `Markdown`
- Currently learning: `Foundry`, `Frontend for Solidity Devs`, `Gas Optimization`
- Next up: `Security Audits`, `Zero Knowledge`, and maybe... `mythical L1 experimentation` 🔮

### 🧭 Vibes, Values & Vision:
- I believe in **code with soul** — not just shipping products, but shifting paradigms
- I’m not here to *chase trends*. I’m here to build things people remember.
- **Quiet conviction > loud hype.**  
- One day, they’ll say “Sam was early.” Until then, we move 💨
